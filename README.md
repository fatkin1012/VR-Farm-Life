# 🌾 VR Farm Life (University Project)

## Overview
**VR Farm Life** is a virtual reality game project developed during my time at university.  
The main inspiration comes from the cozy gameplay and aesthetic of **Stardew Valley** — our goal was to bring that relaxing farming and village-life experience into **immersive VR**.

Players can step into a peaceful countryside world, interact with their surroundings, and enjoy the charm of farming and community life in virtual reality.
